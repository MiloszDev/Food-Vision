# Food-Vision

Food-Vision is a Python-based project that trains a PyTorch image classification model to identify three types of food: Pizza, Steak, and Sushi. This document outlines the structure of the project, key components, and how to use them.

### Key Files and Their Purpose

1. **`train.py`**:

   - This script is responsible for training the PyTorch image classification model. It sets up data loaders, model architecture, and the training process. Key functionalities include:
     - Command-line argument parsing for flexible configuration.
     - Data loading and preprocessing using `data_setup.py`.
     - Model architecture defined in `model_builder.py`.
     - Training process managed by `engine.py`.
     - Model saving using `utils.py`.

2. **`predict.py`**:

   - This script makes predictions on a custom image and plots the result. It uses the trained model to classify a given image and visualize the output, including the predicted label and probability.

3. **`models/`**:

   - This directory contains various modules that support the training and prediction processes:
     - **`data_setup.py`**: Handles data loading and preprocessing.
     - **`engine.py`**: Contains the training loop and evaluation functions.
     - **`model_builder.py`**: Defines the architecture of the image classification model (e.g., TinyVGG).
     - **`utils.py`**: Contains utility functions, including model saving/loading.

4. **`pred_plot.png`**:

   - A placeholder for the prediction plot generated by `predict.py`.

5. **`README.md`**:
   - A markdown file providing an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Installation

To set up the Food-Vision project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Food-Vision.git
   cd Food-Vision
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up your environment** (optional but recommended):
   - Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the model, execute the following command in the terminal, replacing the paths with your dataset paths:

```bash
python train.py --train_dir path_to_training_data --test_dir path_to_testing_data --batch_size 32 --lr 0.001 --num_epochs 10 --hidden_units 128
```

**Arguments:**

- `train_dir`: Path to the training data directory.
- `test_dir`: Path to the testing data directory.
- `batch_size`: Batch size for training and testing (default: 32).
- `lr`: Learning rate for the optimizer (default: 0.001).
- `num_epochs`: Number of epochs to train the model (default: 10).
- `hidden_units`: Number of hidden units in the model (default: 128).

## Making Predictions

To make predictions on a custom image, run the following command:

bash
Skopiuj kod
python predict.py
Ensure that the image you want to predict is specified in the script (currently hardcoded in predict.py).

## Model Architecture

The model architecture used in this project is TinyVGG, designed for simplicity and efficiency in image classification tasks. It is defined in the model_builder.py file.
